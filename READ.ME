## Description

In this repository, I've compiled the HTML code for my personal portfolio website. It's designed to provide you with insights into my background, my projects, and my ways of staying connected. The website is divided into sections like "About Me," "Work," and "Contact Me," making it easy to navigate and explore.

## About Me

I'm Camila Carrasco, and I'm on a journey to becoming a Full Stack Developer. The coding world fascinates me, and I'm always eager to learn more. I'm currently enrolled in the Berkeley Coding Boot Camp, where I'm mastering technologies like JavaScript, Node, SQL, MongoDB, and React. The digital puzzle of coding has captured my attention, and I'm excited about how all these pieces fit together.

## Work

The "Work" section is where I proudly showcase the projects I've been working on. I believe in learning by doing, and these projects reflect my journey of hands-on experience. Here's a sneak peek of what you'll find:

1. [Project 1](https://camsca.github.io/Horiseon-subchanges/): Take a look at my project featuring a code-related image.
2. Project 2: Explore another project with a focus on technology (link coming soon).

## Contact Me

I'd love to connect with you! Here are a couple of ways to reach out:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/Camsca): Connect with me on GitHub to see what I'm working on.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Camila_Carrascx): Feel free to follow me on Twitter and join in on the conversation.
