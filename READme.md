# My Portafolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, I'm sharing my journey as a budding Full Stack Developer. This repository contains the HTML code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects, my passion for coding, and how you can reach out to me.

## Description

In this repository, I've compiled the HTML code for my personal portfolio website. It's designed to provide you with insights into my background, my projects, and my ways of staying connected. The website is divided into sections like "About Me," "Work," and "Contact Me," making it easy to navigate and explore.
