    <p>Hello, I'm Camila
      Aspiring Full Stack Developer | Eager Learner | Coding Enthusiast
      Hey there, I'm Camila
      ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, everyone! I'm Camila, a determined learner currently enrolled in the Berkeley Coding Boot Camp.I'm excited to share my experience and progress as I dive into the world of full stack development. 
      ðŸš€ Eager to Learn and Create:
      Thriving on the possibilities that coding offers, I'm immersing myself in the Berkeley Coding Boot Camp to gain the skills needed to craft impactful web applications.
      ðŸ’¡ Embracing the Challenge:
      I've taken on the challenge of mastering technologies like JavaScript, Node, SQL, MongoDB, and React. My excitement lies in learning how these pieces fit together in the digital puzzle.
      ðŸŒ± Building My Base:
      Currently, I'm in the Foundation phase of the boot camp, where I'm getting my hands on with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This foundational knowledge will soon empower me to craft engaging web applications.
      ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals and Beyond:
      As I progress, I'm eager to challenge myself with a single-page application using the MERN stack. This journey isn't just about acquiring skills; it's about transforming my passion for coding into a meaningful career.</p>
